Analyzing the New York City Squirrel Census Data.

## A bit of background
I had just finished [Coursera's Getting Started with R](https://www.coursera.org/projects/getting-started-with-r) and I wanted to use what I had just learned,
so I looked for an "easy dataset", one with enough data and variables to be able to do an interesting analysis, but also something easy to understand
so I could focus on learning R. Googling I found this [article](https://www.springboard.com/blog/15-fun-datasets-to-analyze/).

## The dataset
A native New Yorker data enthusiast and over 300 volunteers counted and observed the squirrels living in the city â€” all to gather an immense amount of data
that can be found [here](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2019/2019-10-29).

The dataset has 36 variables that I classified into 5 different categories, "ID", "location", "time", "features" and "behavior".

## The project
This repo contains my analysis and a report of it written with RMarkdown. I will update this README once I've completed it.
